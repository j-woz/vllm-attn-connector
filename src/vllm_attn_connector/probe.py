"""Attention-backend override that stashes decode queries. The sensor half.

Queries never enter the KV cache -- they are transient activations, consumed and
freed every step. A ``KVConnector`` therefore cannot see them, which is why
capturing exact attention needs a second extension point.

vLLM provides one: ``register_backend(AttentionBackendEnum.CUSTOM)``
(``v1/attention/backends/registry.py``), documented for exactly this. We
subclass the selected backend's ``Impl``, copy the decode queries, and delegate
everything else to ``super()``. **No vLLM source is patched and no kernel is
touched** -- FlashAttention runs unmodified.

Why the impl and not a module hook
----------------------------------
``Attention.forward`` is traced through by ``torch.compile``; only the custom op
``unified_attention_with_output`` survives as a runtime node, and it dispatches
``self.impl.forward(...)`` dynamically. Overriding the *impl* is therefore the
only hook that is still present in the traced graph; an ``nn.Module`` forward
hook is erased by the trace.

Why that is not enough under CUDA graphs
---------------------------------------
Surviving the trace is not the same as surviving graph replay. A CUDA graph
records the kernels one execution of the trace produced, and a replay runs only
those kernels: no Python. So ``_capture`` runs once, while vLLM captures the
graph, and never again for that graph -- which is every decode step of a served
run, since ``vllm serve`` captures a full graph per decode batch size by
default. A registry that a step-scoped ``clear()`` empties is therefore empty
on every replayed step (issue #2: attn_sum == 0 on every served record).

What does survive replay is the recorded *copy*. So the probe owns one
persistent buffer per layer, allocated outside any capture, and ``_capture``
copies into it. During capture that copy becomes a recorded kernel; every
replay of that graph re-runs it and the buffer holds the current step's
queries with no Python involved. The buffer is never cleared -- clearing it
would be exactly the bug -- so the connector instead asks whether the write it
is about to read is fresh *for this step*:

* a live write is fresh only for the step it ran on, tracked by a step
  generation the connector bumps once per step.
* a recorded write is fresh whenever a decode graph ran, and on a pure decode
  step one always does. ``_capture`` asks
  ``torch.cuda.is_current_stream_capturing()``, so it knows directly whether
  its copy is being recorded rather than executed, and remembers the largest
  decode batch it was recorded for. A decode step of no more rows than that
  replayed a graph that writes this buffer.

Why not key the buffer by the graph vLLM is about to replay: the connector
cannot see which one that is. ``wait_for_save`` runs from ``post_forward`` in
``v1/worker/gpu/model_runner.py``, which is outside the ``set_forward_context``
block, and on the FULL path ``pre_forward`` is outside it too, so
``get_forward_context`` is either unset or carries ``cudagraph_runtime_mode =
NONE`` with no batch descriptor. Observed in job 3166664: the probe recorded 51
graph keys during capture and the connector read ``None`` on every decode step.
Asking whether a capture happened, which the probe can answer for itself, does
not depend on the runner's plumbing.

The inference is sound for every cudagraph mode vLLM ships, because the
dispatcher never sends a pure decode batch to a graph the probe skipped.
``FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`` and ``FULL_DECODE_ONLY`` capture a separate uniform
decode graph per size, which is what the probe records; ``PIECEWISE`` leaves
attention outside the graph, so the probe runs live; a batch too large for any
graph runs eager, so the probe runs live. Plain ``cudagraph_mode=FULL`` captures
only mixed-shaped graphs, which the probe skips, so it records nothing and the
connector refuses every step with a warning rather than reading a stale buffer.

Sizing: one buffer per layer, ``max_rows x heads x head_size``, where
``max_rows`` covers the largest captured decode batch. Not one buffer per
graph: that would be ~30x the memory (the capture sizes sum to far more than
the largest one), and it buys nothing, since every graph writes the rows it
owns and the connector only ever reads the rows the current step filled.

Why decode only
---------------
vLLM v1 orders decode requests first in the batch and exposes
``num_decode_tokens``. In decode each request contributes exactly one query
token, so batch row *i* is request slot *i* -- no ``query_start_loc`` parsing,
no token-to-request mapping. Prefill queries are skipped: capturing them is
O(T^2) work and O(T*H*D) memory per layer.

The copy is small (``num_decode_reqs x heads x head_size``) but it must happen
on the current stream: ``query`` is a buffer vLLM reuses next step, so a
deferred copy could read it after ``q_proj`` has overwritten it.
